# Metro Transit Systems Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a detailed analysis of global metro transit systems. The project involved data cleaning, transformation, visualization using Python, and an interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing key insights.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Cleaning**: 
  - Removed inconsistencies and null values.
  - Standardized data formats for uniformity.
  - Added calculated columns to enhance the dataset.

- **Python Visualizations**:
  - Developed insightful charts and graphs for data exploration.
  - Used libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for interactive and static visualizations.

- **Power BI Dashboard**:
  - Created an interactive dashboard to visualize the metro systems' data.
  - **Key Features**:
    - **Oldest and Newest Metro Systems**: Highlighted the oldest metro system (1863) and the newest (2025).
    - **Sum of Lines by City**: Bar chart showing cities with the highest number of metro lines.
    - **Global Coverage**: A map displaying metro systems around the world.
    - **Total Operational Length by Country**: Insights into the countries with the most extensive metro networks.
  - Custom slicers and filters for enhanced interactivity.
